            <h4>Frachti Cave and Paralia</h4>
            <p>
						<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/greece/southwest-argolis/attractions/frachti-cave-paralia/a/poi-sig/1571575/1336410">Frachti Cave</a> is one of Greeceâ€™s oldest and most significant Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic sites. Offshore, there is a submerged Neolithic settlement, Paralia; the shoreline was a further 7km away back then.<br>
							We will plan a hike tour to the site on Sunday or Monday after the wedding day. Site has free entrance and is open during the visiting hours.						</p>
            <h4>Lakkes</h4>
            <p>
						It is our favorite beach, 15km from Ermioni.
            </p>
            <h4>Hiking</h4>
            <p>
						There is a hiking route from near our house through the Katafyki gorge that leads to either Fourni village or the mountainous village Heliocastro.
