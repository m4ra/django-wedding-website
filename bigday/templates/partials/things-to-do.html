            <h4>Tavernas</h4>

            <h4>Frachti Cave and Paralia</h4>
            <p>
						<a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/greece/southwest-argolis/attractions/frachti-cave-paralia/a/poi-sig/1571575/1336410" style="text-decoration: underline;">Frachti Cave</a> is one of Greeceâ€™s oldest and most significant Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic sites. Offshore, there is a submerged Neolithic settlement, Paralia; the shoreline was a further 7km away back then.<br>
							We will plan a hike tour to the site on Sunday or Monday after the wedding day. Site has free entrance and is open during the visiting hours.						</p>
            <h4>Lakkes</h4>
            <p>
						It is our favorite beach, 15km from Ermioni.

            </p>
            <h4>Hiking</h4>
            <p>
						There is a hiking route from near our house through the Katafyki gorge that leads to either Fourni village or the mountainous village Heliocastro. This will be our second option for hiking (more relaxing) if we don't make it to the Frachti Cave.
