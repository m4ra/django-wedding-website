                        We are doing our rehearsal dinner at the same venue.
                        The brewery will have a patio open to the public at this time and guests should feel free
                        to come early and enjoy food and drink before the official party starts
                        (though we've been told it might get crowded).
                        Weâ€™ll open the doors whenever we finish eating but by 9 at the latest.
